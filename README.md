<h2> ‚ú® About The Project</h2>

- MERN stack
- Full Responsive

- In this project, I wanted to use the react and redux toolkit, which I always use, together with typescript, and I wanted to make an e-commerce application using them. In this project, I tried to do operations such as listing products, seeing product details, adding/removing to cart, adding/removing to favorites, searching for products, ordering the products in the basket. My project is fully responsive, I hope you like it :)
